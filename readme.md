# Decoder Ring
A Thinkful capstone on writing complex Javascript algorithms and creating unit tests
Live deployment of app can be found [here](https://mastraus.github.io/decoder-ring/).

## Installation
1. Download files, unzip, and open in code editor.
2. From command line, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
3. The three decoder ring pieces will each decode/encode differently: Caesar shift will "shift" the alphabet the number of spaces you indicate, Polybius transcribes each message as each letter being a pair of numbers, and Substitution substitutes a standard alphabet with a mock alphabet (where an input of A would become X, for example).

## Learning Outcomes
Through the creation of this capstone project, I specifically coded:
1. All three complex Javascript algorithms to correctly decode and encode messages
2. All three unit tests using Mocha and Chai for each decoder type
3. Different expect() methods to test the code's functionality against what I expected to happen
